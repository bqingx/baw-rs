# wallets：实际 CLI 参数

由 `scripts/build_skill_reference.py` 从 `baw-rs 0.3.0` 的 `--help` 生成。
这不是运行授权；命令含义、资金确认及对账流程以主 skill 和工作流参考为准。
普通业务命令须带 `--wallet <NAME>`（或传统 `--wallet-dir` 组合）；`wallets/openfour` 各有独立参数入口。

## `wallets`

```text
Wallet lifecycle and named resident daemon. Never requires --wallet

Usage: baw-rs wallets [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  add     Create private wallet paths (0700) and an identity file (0600), then register the name
  remove  Unregister a name. Wallet data is kept unless --delete-data is given with --confirm
  list    Registered names and their paths. Never reads sessions or contacts the backend
  status  Resident daemon status: pid and the names it was started with
  serve   Run the resident daemon in the foreground for every registered wallet
  stop    Stop accepting work, drain admitted requests, then exit
  help    Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
      --wallet <NAME>
          Name of a registered wallet. Required for every wallet-scoped command unless the legacy --wallet-dir pair is given
      --registry <PATH>
          Registry directory. Defaults to $BAW_RS_REGISTRY, else $HOME/wallets/registry
